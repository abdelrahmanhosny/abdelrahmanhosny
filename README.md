### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m on a mission to develop innovative ML methods that solve complex optimization problems (e.g. in chip design, operations research, and cloud computing). 
- ðŸŽ“ I graudated from Brown University with a PhD in Computer Science. My thesis has been about the use of machine learning methods in combinatorial optimization.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to fail fast.
